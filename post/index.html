        &#34;Sibling Gender, Inheritance Norms and Human Capital Formation in Sub-Saharan Africa”, Matthew Collins
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I study how sibling gender, a central part of the childhood experience, affects the educational outcomes of children across 36 Sub-Saharan African countries. Using data from the Demographic and Health Survey, I estimate the causal effect of having a next-born brother relative to a sister and how it varies across ethnic groups according to inheritance norms. Girls experience a small negative effect of having a brother. In both patrilineal and matrilineal societies, male property is inherited by other male heirs, but specifically who inherits the property varies by kinship, with sons directly inheriting their father’s property in most patrilineal societies, while in matrilineal societies, property is generally transferred to the son (or sons) of a man’s sister.

        &#34;Job Loss and Domestic Violence: Evidence from Denmark”, Anne Sophie Lassen
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In this study, we investigate the effect of job loss on couple dynamics and domestic violence. By using employer-employee linked data from Denmark, we identify plant closures that were exogenous to the workers to apply an event-study design. We focus on sectors where plant closure lead to substantial unemployment and investigate the changes in relationship status and risk of domestic violence. We find gender differences in changes in relationship status after job loss.

      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      By varying the intensity of compulsory schooling while keeping the number of compulsory school years constant, this paper generates new insights into the effect of human capital on fertility on the extensive and intensive margin. We leverage population-wide panel data for Norway in combination with a school reform in the 1930s changing the instruction time during the school year that allows us to isolate the effect of human capital investment on fertility behavior across the life-cycle from an incarceration effect.

        &#34;How Valuable Are Business Networks? Evidence from Salesmen in Internatoinal Goods Markets&#34;, Bérengère Patault
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      How to gain new buyers and expand one’s business? This paper provides a very simple answer to this question: by hiring salesmen. Combining French firm-to-firm trade data with a detailed occupational dataset, we offer new empirical evidence that salesmen play a role for the construction of a firm’s portfolio of foreign buyers. We then characterize a specific channel explaining such a role: using an event-study design, we show that a poached salesman brings on average 0.

        &#34;Revealing Equity Principles from Tax Policy&#34;, Kristoffer Berg
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Which equity principles can support current tax policy? This paper shows how vertical and horizontal equity rationalize tax policy choices by governments. While vertical equity provides the standard inequality aversion rationale for redistributive taxation, most tax models ignore horizontal equity. Horizontal equity introduces a restriction against tax discrimination based on certain characteristics, which is necessary to explain current tax policy. The first contribution is to map the government’s total marginal priority into the concerns for vertical and horizontal equity.

        &#34;Export Shocks and Firm Competition&#34;, Simone Maria Bonin
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Are export shocks transmitted between firms competing in the same labour market? In particular, how does labour market competition affect firms and workers that are exposed to successful exporters? To answer these questions, we employ administrative linked employer-employee dataset covering the population of Danish firms and workers, a novel approach to define labour markets through clustered worker transitions between jobs, and an empirical strategy based on shocks to firm-level export stemming from variation in World Import Demand.

        &#34;Child Care and Later-In-Life Delinquency&#34;, Mirjam Wentzel

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Formal child care has proven to affect long-term outcomes, such as education, income and health, but does it also change the risk of later-in-life delinquency? In this paper, I investigate how formal child care affects criminal charges in youth or adulthood. I use multiple reforms connected to formal child care in Norway, together with rich Norwegian register data, identifying differential access or incentives to use formal child care. I find that formal child care can decrease the likelihood of being charged, driven by men.

        &#34;Gender Peer Composition and Labour Market Outcomes&#34;, Demid Getik

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This Seminar will start 15 minutes later than usual (12:30 to 13:30).
We examine how the gender composition in compulsory school affects gender gaps in subsequent labour-market outcomes. For identification, we rely on Swedish administrative data and cohort variation in peer gender within schools. We find that an increase in the share of girls improves girls' wages and diminishes the gap in both actual and potential earnings. There appear to be no significant effects on boys' labour-market outcomes.

        &#34;Early Schooling and Maternal Labour Market Outcomes: Evidence from a New School Entry Policy Using Exact Date of Birth in Brazil&#34;, Daniel Duque
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This paper aims to use a national age-at-school-entry policy to identify the causal effect of mothers getting their children enrolled a year earlier in Primary School. Brazilian public and private primary schools admit children up to one year younger than the national minimum age to enter school if their birthday is before an arbitrary threshold, defined as March 31. Using a Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design and a Fixed-Effects Event-Study, we estimate the impact of having children enrolled in Primary School on mothers’ labor outcomes, using longitudinal data from a quarterly Brazilian socioeconomic survey.

        &#34;Heterogeneous Employment Effects of Firms Financial Constraints and Wageless Recoveries&#34;, Gabriel Züllig
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This paper studies the interaction of firm liquidity, employment and wages in light of credit supply disruptions. I establish that firms borrowing from banks highly exposed to the money-market freeze during the Global Financial Crisis received a shock to external liquidity, relative to otherwise similar firms. This constraint led to a significant drop in employment in affected firms, while wages did not fall relative to unaffected firms. In order to retain cash flow and build up internal liquidity, constrained firms cut labor cost predominantly by changing the composition of their labor force in favor of workers with lower wages.
