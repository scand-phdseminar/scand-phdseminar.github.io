        &#34;Early Schooling and Maternal Labour Market Outcomes: Evidence from a New School Entry Policy Using Exact Date of Birth in Brazil&#34;, Daniel Duque
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This paper aims to use a national age-at-school-entry policy to identify the causal effect of mothers getting their children enrolled a year earlier in Primary School. Brazilian public and private primary schools admit children up to one year younger than the national minimum age to enter school if their birthday is before an arbitrary threshold, defined as March 31. Using a Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design and a Fixed-Effects Event-Study, we estimate the impact of having children enrolled in Primary School on mothers’ labor outcomes, using longitudinal data from a quarterly Brazilian socioeconomic survey.

        &#34;Heterogeneous Employment Effects of Firms Financial Constraints and Wageless Recoveries&#34;, Gabriel Züllig
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This paper studies the interaction of firm liquidity, employment and wages in light of credit supply disruptions. I establish that firms borrowing from banks highly exposed to the money-market freeze during the Global Financial Crisis received a shock to external liquidity, relative to otherwise similar firms. This constraint led to a significant drop in employment in affected firms, while wages did not fall relative to unaffected firms. In order to retain cash flow and build up internal liquidity, constrained firms cut labor cost predominantly by changing the composition of their labor force in favor of workers with lower wages.

        &#34;Earnings and Labor Market Dynamics: Predicting Macro Dynamics using Micro Data&#34;, Johan Holmberg
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In this paper I build a life cycle earnings dynamics model including endogenous employment and job changes and estimate it with indirect inference using Swedish register data. By simulating data from this microeconomic model I study macroeconomic consequences of transitory shocks to unemployment risk. The results show that transitory aggregate shocks to unemployment risk have have long lasting negative effects on employment, income and earnings volatility. I also provide some insights on what effects unemployment at various stages during the working life has on the accumulation of pension entitlements.

        &#34;The Return of the King The Effect of the Civil War in Greece on Female Labor Force Participation&#34;, Xanthi Tsoukli
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Using the civil war in Greece as an exogenous shock, this paper investigates the relationship between conflict and female labor force participation. The civil war in Greece was the result of a struggle between left and right ideologies. Exploiting a referendum that took place right before the outbreak of the civil war in 1946 regarding the return of the King, the paper shows that provinces with high concentration of communists experience a higher female labor force participation after the war.

        &#34;The Cultural Assimilation of Individualism and Preferences for Redistribution&#34;, Olle Hammar
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In this study, I analyze the relationship between individualism and preferences for income redistribution and equality, using variation in immigrants' countries of origin to capture the impact of cultural beliefs on individual preferences. Using global survey data for a large number of individuals and countries around the world, I find strong support for the hypothesis that coming from a more individualistic culture is negatively and significantly associated with an individual&rsquo;s preferences for redistribution.

      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      We study the implications of robot adoption at the level of individual firms using a rich panel data-set of Spanish manufacturing firms over a 27-year period (1990-2016). We focus on three central questions: (1) Which firms adopt robots? (2) What are the labor market effects of robot adoption at the firm level? (3) How does firm heterogeneity in robot adoption affect the industry equilibrium? To address these questions, we look at our data through the lens of recent attempts in the literature to formalize the implications of robot technology.

        &#34;The Effects of More Informative Grading in Early Schooling: Evidence from Sweden&#34;, Matthew Collins
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      It is well established that education has a significant effect on earnings. Moreover, academic skills have been shown to determine a host of non-pecuniary benefits. The imparting of academic skills and human capital can be increased if inputs in education production are used more efficiently. One such input is the provision of performance feedback. Using data on the population of Swedish school children, we identify a natural experiment arising from a reform to the grading system in compulsory school which introduced a more granular grading scale and thus provided students with more informative feedback on their performance.

        &#34;The Cost of Terrorism: Network Effects and the Economic Impact of Child Loss&#34;, Ragnar Alne and Nina Serdarevic
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Using a difference-in-differences model on full population data, we estimate the causal effects of a terrorist attack on labor market and social insurance outcomes of bereaved parents. Compared with non-bereaved parents, we find substantial negative effects. One mechanism through which these changes occur is impaired psychological health. This result is consistent with theoretical and empirical work emphasizing the connection between adverse health shocks and labor market outcomes. Moreover, the results suggest that the cost of terrorism and the value of preventive measures may be underestimated if negative spillover effects to the victims’ family network remain unrecognized.
