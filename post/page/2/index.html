        &#34;Revealing Equity Principles from Tax Policy&#34;, Kristoffer Berg
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Which equity principles can support current tax policy? This paper shows how vertical and horizontal equity rationalize tax policy choices by governments. While vertical equity provides the standard inequality aversion rationale for redistributive taxation, most tax models ignore horizontal equity. Horizontal equity introduces a restriction against tax discrimination based on certain characteristics, which is necessary to explain current tax policy. The first contribution is to map the government’s total marginal priority into the concerns for vertical and horizontal equity.

        &#34;Export Shocks and Firm Competition&#34;, Simone Maria Bonin
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Are export shocks transmitted between firms competing in the same labour market? In particular, how does labour market competition affect firms and workers that are exposed to successful exporters? To answer these questions, we employ administrative linked employer-employee dataset covering the population of Danish firms and workers, a novel approach to define labour markets through clustered worker transitions between jobs, and an empirical strategy based on shocks to firm-level export stemming from variation in World Import Demand.

        &#34;Child Care and Later-In-Life Delinquency&#34;, Mirjam Wentzel

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Formal child care has proven to affect long-term outcomes, such as education, income and health, but does it also change the risk of later-in-life delinquency? In this paper, I investigate how formal child care affects criminal charges in youth or adulthood. I use multiple reforms connected to formal child care in Norway, together with rich Norwegian register data, identifying differential access or incentives to use formal child care. I find that formal child care can decrease the likelihood of being charged, driven by men.

        &#34;Gender Peer Composition and Labour Market Outcomes&#34;, Demid Getik
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This Seminar will start 15 minutes later than usual (12:30 to 13:30).
We examine how the gender composition in compulsory school affects gender gaps in subsequent labour-market outcomes. For identification, we rely on Swedish administrative data and cohort variation in peer gender within schools. We find that an increase in the share of girls improves girls' wages and diminishes the gap in both actual and potential earnings. There appear to be no significant effects on boys' labour-market outcomes.

        &#34;Early Schooling and Maternal Labour Market Outcomes: Evidence from a New School Entry Policy Using Exact Date of Birth in Brazil&#34;, Daniel Duque
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This paper aims to use a national age-at-school-entry policy to identify the causal effect of mothers getting their children enrolled a year earlier in Primary School. Brazilian public and private primary schools admit children up to one year younger than the national minimum age to enter school if their birthday is before an arbitrary threshold, defined as March 31. Using a Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design and a Fixed-Effects Event-Study, we estimate the impact of having children enrolled in Primary School on mothers’ labor outcomes, using longitudinal data from a quarterly Brazilian socioeconomic survey.

        &#34;Heterogeneous Employment Effects of Firms Financial Constraints and Wageless Recoveries&#34;, Gabriel Züllig
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This paper studies the interaction of firm liquidity, employment and wages in light of credit supply disruptions. I establish that firms borrowing from banks highly exposed to the money-market freeze during the Global Financial Crisis received a shock to external liquidity, relative to otherwise similar firms. This constraint led to a significant drop in employment in affected firms, while wages did not fall relative to unaffected firms. In order to retain cash flow and build up internal liquidity, constrained firms cut labor cost predominantly by changing the composition of their labor force in favor of workers with lower wages.

        &#34;Earnings and Labor Market Dynamics: Predicting Macro Dynamics using Micro Data&#34;, Johan Holmberg
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In this paper I build a life cycle earnings dynamics model including endogenous employment and job changes and estimate it with indirect inference using Swedish register data. By simulating data from this microeconomic model I study macroeconomic consequences of transitory shocks to unemployment risk. The results show that transitory aggregate shocks to unemployment risk have have long lasting negative effects on employment, income and earnings volatility. I also provide some insights on what effects unemployment at various stages during the working life has on the accumulation of pension entitlements.

        &#34;The Return of the King The Effect of the Civil War in Greece on Female Labor Force Participation&#34;, Xanthi Tsoukli
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Using the civil war in Greece as an exogenous shock, this paper investigates the relationship between conflict and female labor force participation. The civil war in Greece was the result of a struggle between left and right ideologies. Exploiting a referendum that took place right before the outbreak of the civil war in 1946 regarding the return of the King, the paper shows that provinces with high concentration of communists experience a higher female labor force participation after the war.

        &#34;The Cultural Assimilation of Individualism and Preferences for Redistribution&#34;, Olle Hammar
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In this study, I analyze the relationship between individualism and preferences for income redistribution and equality, using variation in immigrants' countries of origin to capture the impact of cultural beliefs on individual preferences. Using global survey data for a large number of individuals and countries around the world, I find strong support for the hypothesis that coming from a more individualistic culture is negatively and significantly associated with an individual&rsquo;s preferences for redistribution.
